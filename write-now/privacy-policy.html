        <p>Your notes and their contents are never sent to nor analyzed by any service and are only locally stored on your device. The following discloses instances in which we may collect information.</p>

        <p><u>FEEDBACK SENDER</u></p>
        <p>When you send feedback to us using the in-app form, we will transmit the following information:

        <br/>• Email (if provided)
        <br/>• Your comments
        <br/>• App version
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p><u>CRASHLYTICS</u></p>
        <p>We use Crashlytics (Firebase), a service provided by Google Inc., to collect logs on crashes and errors within the app. When a crash or error occurs, Crashlytics may collect and send any or all of the following:

        <br/>• Time of incident
        <br/>• App version
        <br/>
        <br/>Any data transmitted to Crashlytics is never stored or sent to any other service and is not associated with any data available to Google. You may opt out of crash reporting in settings. You can read more about how Firebase uses your data by viewing the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">privacy policies for Firebase.</a>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p><u>GOOGLE ANALYTICS FOR FIREBASE</u></p>
        <p>We use Google Analytics for Firebase, a service provided by Google Inc., to collect data on how users are using our product to inform how we can better improve our user experience. Data collected may include any or all of the following:
        <br/>

        </p>
        <br/>
        <p><u>GOOGLE DRIVE</u></p>
        <p>You can link your Google Drive account to Write Now to enable automatic backups of your notes. Write Now will have access to following information from your Google account:
        <br/>
        <br/>• Name
        <br/>• Email
        <br/>• Public profile picture
        <br/>• Storage quota
        <br/>
        <br/>This data is only used within the app on the device and is never transmitted to any service. We only use your email to indicate which Google account is linked to Write Now. Storage quota is used by the backup system to check whether how much storage is left on your Google Drive account before uploading and sycning a backup. Your name and public profile picture are not used in any manner nor ever transmitted. While Write Now is linked to your Google Drive account and automatic backups is enabled, Write Now will periodically upload a snapshot file containing your note data and potentially deleting old backups as your backup folder becomes full. Write Now will only have access to content it syncs to your Google Drive account. This includes uploading backup files, fetching available backup files and folders, and downloading backup files. The rest of your personal data and files on Google Drive are inaccessible. You can unlink your Google Drive account at any time from settings. You can also revoke Write Now sign-in from your Google account settings page to unlink all Write Now installations across your devices.
